							Java Programming Language
						</h1>
						<p class="text-small">
							When compared with C++, Java codes
							are generally more maintainable
							because Java does not allow many
							things which may lead to
							bad/inefficient programming if used
							incorrectly. For example,
							non-primitives are always references
							in Java. So we cannot pass large
							objects (like we can do in C++) to
							functions, we always pass references
							in Java. One more example, since there
							are no pointers, bad memory access
							is also not possible. When compared
							with Python, Java kind of fits between
							C++ and Python. The programs are written
							in Java typically run faster than
							corresponding Python programs and slower
							than C++. Like C++, Java does static
							type checking, but Python does not.
